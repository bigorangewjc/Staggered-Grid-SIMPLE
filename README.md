3. Compile: python Staggered-SIMPLE.py
4. After running, results will be stored in the ./results folder
5. Parameter tuning: All cases with different schemes would be run in the code, so no need to change parameters. If you wanna change the parameters, just go to the first several lines of the main function, which is at the bottom of the code, to change the parameters you'd like to.
